# DONT_DELETE_YR_BANDCAMP

Hi, I know [the news](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bandcamp-layoffs-following-songtradr-acquisition-1234855267/) can be scary. Please don't delete your bandcamp. There is so much unique stuff on the platform that I'd be heartbroken to see removed and never resurfaced. That is what I want to avoid. We have time to think about this.

Bandcamp still is the last big bastion of freely available files not locked down by advertisements. And I have a feeling it'll still be alive for a while too, but a 50% workforce layoff is never a good sign. Don't lose hope that the service can never return to stability, but just keep an eye on ways you don't have to be tied to one service. As artists we have to stay flexible with what the best deal for us is. Bandcamp is still one of the best deals, with its workers unionized, but there's still [plenty of ways it can still improve its accountability and transparency as a platform](https://www.bandcampunited.org/).

If you're an artist looking for a quick alternative, [make an itch.io account](https://itch.io/register) and use [scritch editor](https://torcado.itch.io/scritch-editor) to host your music in a bandcamp-style player on that website. It's so good, [here's scritch in action (with a paid download)](https://halleylabs.itch.io/arcregn).

It's the best alternative I know of for grassroots indie musicians, requiring barely any more effort to setup compared to bandcamp. Use direct payments and see your country's tax laws for information on what to track as a business.

# BUT IN THE MEANTIME

Don't delete your bandcamp! Okay? Give it some time, think about the best way to preserve your internet presence for others to find your music.

As a centralized spot for indie musicians, we can't lose the ties that made us discoverable in the first place. You don't have to be paid per stream because fans can pay you almost directly. It's still the best value you can get out of putting your music online if you're not already finding momentum as an artist.

# If you want to protest the buyout and the layoffs:

Artists:
- Make your music free to download on bandcamp (if you can afford to do so)
- Provide an alternate free download options through various file hosts like [mediafire](https://mediafire.com/) or [dropbox](dropbox.com).
- Mimic the experience of using bandcamp by using [scritch editor](https://torcado.itch.io/scritch-editor) and [making an itch.io account](https://itch.io/register) to host and charge for downloads of your music.
Listeners:
- [Download your bandcamp collection with the Batchcamp addon](https://howtohifi.com/bulk-download-your-entire-bandcamp-collection-with-batchcamp-chrome-extension/) and listen locally, instead of using the service to stream music

# How can I archive what's on bandcamp?
You want to help with the effort? Great!
1. You can [archive a bandcamp page](web.archive.org) as it appears right now.
2. You can download the freely available low-quality song previews using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), just type `yt-dlp` then the page url in the command prompt once it's installed.
3. You can download your purchases to store elsewhere.
